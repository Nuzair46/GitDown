* A simple node to download particular text files from github repository. My try for [DownGit](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/).

## To run.
* `node down.js <url_to_file>`. 

## To Do.
* Add support for more files.
* Implement via website with no node.
* It's my first js code, the code can be improved.
